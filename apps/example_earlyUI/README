The first step is set up the UI. This includes any covariate information you
wish for the user to input, and the way you plan for the user to input dosing
and plasma sample data.

In this case "input.ui" functions are used. These require the app developer
to consider how many inputs are desired for each row, and adjust the functions
in global.R accordingly. Also consider what type of input these should be
(i.e. numericInput, textInput), so that they match with the reactiveValues
data.frames in server.R.

It is desired for users to be able to add and remove rows form these input
boxes, ensuring this base code is working with the desired layout of input
types is important before adding additional complexity.

Changes made to "input.ui" functions, require corresponding changes to the
"input.update" functions so that the add, remove and save buttons work.

The second tab has a plan for the general layout, but the actual output is not
important at this stage.
